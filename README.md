This algorithm written in python, will read the input.html file and will store the values of the attributes in a string. Finally will convert the string to output.svg file.

# How to run

1.  Create an input.html file with the code you want to convert or simply change the code of the existing one.
2.  Open the terminal and run the command ```python algorithm.py```
5.  The output.svg will be generated (or modified if already exists). Copy the file and be happy!
