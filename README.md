Convert and HTML file to SVG file in python

This algorithm written in python, will read the input.html file and will store the values of the attributes in a string. Finally will convert the string to output.svg file.

# How to run

1.  Create an input.html file with the code you want to convert or simply change the code of the existing one.
2.  In the root folder run the following command in the terminal to install all the packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3.  Open the terminal and run the command ```python algorithm.py```
5.  The output.svg will be generated (or modified if already exists). Copy the file and be happy!
